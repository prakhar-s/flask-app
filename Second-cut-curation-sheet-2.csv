The long legged hunting spiders are capable of running very fast and jump on their prey like a cat. Hence, their common name is lynx.
They do not make a web but activily hunt their prey.
Although their eyesight is not as good as that of the jumping spiders they can see their prey from a distance of up to 10 centimeters. They have two large front eyes besides a smaller pair, two on the side of their head and two large ones looking above and backward giving them an almost 360 degree view

which may become real danger at times. I met one person who had to amputate a portion of one of his feet after being bitten by one of them.

346068715469086,Vijay Barve,"Spiders are one of the most fascinating creatures we see everyday and most photographers love photographing them. But I would like to hear from people who can identify them, on what needs to be captured if we want to identify them with good degree of reliability. I am aware that not all species can be confirmed without specimen, but I am looking at some hints to improve the quality of photographs for identification.","The best one is Good quality shots from all possible angles. :)
Things that are needed at least are 1, 2 & 3

1) Full dorsal shot (if possible with a size reference or measurements should be noted.), side shot
2) Eye arrangement (From front and above)
3) Shots of legs
4) Shots of pedipalps
5) If possible, shot of the epigynum, which may not be useful with a photograph but it is always good to have extra reference
6) In case of large species a shot of spinnerets would be good too
7) And when in web; a shot of web & microhabitat

I might have missed something, which the experts will surely add to. And never mind if someone tells you even after most of these things, it can't be identified till species level. | Saurabh Sawant this is helpful. May be we should make a document and post in on the group to help members. | Sure. That sounds great.","Spiders are one of the most fascinating creatures we see everyday and most photographers love photographing them.
